📊 E-commerce Marketing & Sales Case Study

💡 **Business Objective**

This project aims to analyze key customer and sales trends for an e-commerce company to improve customer acquisition, retention, and overall revenue generation. Through data exploration and visualization, we uncover actionable insights to support strategic decisions.

📂 **Dataset Overview**

**Source**: [Data Folder](./data/)

**Contents**: Online_Sales.csv, CustomersData.xlsx, Discount_Coupon.csv, Marketing_Spend.csv, Tax_amount.xlsx

📅 Analysis Scope

This analysis addresses 20 key business questions:

1. Identify the months with the highest and lowest acquisition rates. What strategies could be implemented to address the fluctuations and ensure consistent growth throughout the year?

**Answer:** January has the highest acquisition rates.
            December has the lowest acquisition rates.

        strategies : 
        1) As January has the highest monthly acquisitions, align promotional campaigns with peak months and improve visibility in weaker months. This matches the count near the peak month. 

        2) To increase month-on-month growth, introduce new offers and spend more on marketing. Encourage referrals with great offers and perks for both existing and new users.
