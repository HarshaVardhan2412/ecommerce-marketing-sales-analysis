üìÖ Analysis Scope

This analysis addresses 20 key business questions:

**Business Question 1:** Identify the months with the highest and lowest acquisition rates. What strategies could be implemented to address the fluctuations and ensure consistent growth throughout the year?

**Answer:** 
    Please find chart here : [acquisition_trend barplot](./images/Q1_acquisition_barplot.png) , [acquisition_trend lineplot](./images/Q2_acquisition_lineplot.png)

    **Highest Acquisition:**

        January 2019 (~215 customers), followed by March and April.

    **Lowest Acquisition:**

        November 2019 (~70 customers), followed by September and October.

    **Trend:**
        There is a steady decline in customer acquisition throughout the year.

[![Acquisition Trend Lineplot](./images/Q2_acquisition_lineplot.png)](./images/Q2_acquisition_lineplot.png)

    
    strategies : 
        1) As January has the highest monthly acquisitions, align promotional campaigns with peak months and improve visibility in weaker months. This matches the count near the peak month. 

        2) To increase month-on-month growth, introduce new offers and spend more on marketing. Encourage referrals with great offers and perks for both existing and new users. 


**Business Question 2:** Analyze the data to determine if certain months consistently show higher or lower acquisition rates. How can the company capitalize on high-performing months and improve performance during slower periods?

**Answer:** 
    Please find chart here :  [acquisition_trend barplot](./images/Q1_acquisition_barplot.png) , [acquisition_trend lineplot](./images/Q2_acquisition_lineplot.png) , [Scatter Plot](./images/acquisition_vs_marketing_scatter.png)

    **Analysis:**

        **Top 25% Months by Acquisition (High-performing):**

            January (215), March (177), April (163)

        **Bottom 25% Months (Low-performing):**

            September (78), October (87), November (68)

[![acquisition_trend barplot](./images/Q1_acquisition_barplot.png)](./images/Q1_acquisition_barplot.png)

    **Trend:**

        1) We saw strong customer growth from January to April, likely due to successful early-year campaigns or the 2) usual new-year shopping enthusiasm.

        2) From June onward, customer numbers started dropping steadily, hitting the lowest point in November.

        3) There wasn‚Äôt much of a bounce-back in December, which means end-of-year efforts didn‚Äôt have a big impact.

    **strategies :**(How can the company capitalize on high-performing months and improve performance during slower periods?)

        1) Focus on the Best Months: Put more marketing money and effort into January to April, when customer sign-ups are strong. Look at what worked in the past and do more of that.

        2) Find Out What‚Äôs Going Wrong in Slow Months: Dig into the data from slower months like September to November. Check where your traffic is coming from, how far users get, and why they might be dropping off.

        3) Try Offers During Slow Periods: Run special deals or referral bonuses during the quiet months to see if they help bring in more customers.

        4) Plan Ahead with Predictions: Use simple forecasting tools to spot future slowdowns early. That way, you can plan smart marketing moves before things dip.

    üìà Customer Acquisition vs. Marketing Spend: 

            To understand what influences customer acquisition, marketing data was chosen for analysis. Other datasets like sales, coupons, and tax were excluded because they are either related to customer behavior after acquisition (like sales and coupon usage) or are not directly relevant (like tax rates).

            Marketing efforts, especially online and offline campaigns, are directly responsible for creating awareness and attracting potential new customers. This made the marketing dataset the most relevant for analyzing acquisition trends.

            Daily marketing spend data was combined with daily customer acquisition counts, which were calculated from each customer‚Äôs first transaction date. A scatter plot was used to visualize the relation between marketing spend and new customer acquisition. Correlation was then calculated to measure the strength of the relationship.

[![Scatter Plot](./images/acquisition_vs_marketing_scatter.png)](./images/acquisition_vs_marketing_scatter.png)

    üîç Correlation Matrix:

            Online_Spend	Offline_Spend	New_Customers
            Online_Spend	1.000	0.360	-0.033
            Offline_Spend	0.360	1.000	-0.024
            New_Customers	-0.033	-0.024	1.000

    The results showed a very weak negative correlation between both online and offline marketing spend and new customer acquisition. This indicates that higher spending on any particular day did not strongly influence how many customers joined on that same day.

**Business Question 3:** Identify periods with the strongest and weakest retention rates. What strategies could be implemented to improve retention during weaker months?

**Answer:** 
    Please find chart here : [Retention Rate HeatMap](./images/Q3_RetentionRate.png) , [Avg Retention Rate Barplot](./images/Q3_AvgRetentionRate.png)

    **Approach:**

        1) Built a retention matrix using transaction data.

        2) Used a heatmap to quickly spot how customers came back over months.

        3) Created a simple average retention trend per month.

    **Key Findings:**

        **Heatmap Observation:**
            1) Customers acquired in August and July showed better retention trends, with higher percentages in the following months.

            2) February and April had the lowest retention, showing rapid drop after the first month.

[![Retention Rate HeatMap](./images/Q3_RetentionRate.png)](./images/Q3_RetentionRate.png)

        **Retention Trend Chart Insight:**
            1) The average retention rate peaked in August (~30%), while February was the lowest (~16%).

            2) This pattern suggests mid-year cohorts tend to be more loyal.

[![Avg Retention Rate Barplot](./images/Q3_AvgRetentionRate.png)](./images/Q3_AvgRetentionRate.png)
    
    strategies : 
        1) For Feb and April, let's look deeper into what campaigns or offers we used and how those customers behaved.

        2) Try early follow-ups, personalized nudges, or small loyalty perks‚Äîespecially in their first week.

        3) For Jul and Aug, let's learn what worked well and try replicating those strategies during weak months.

**Business Question 4:** **Analyze customer behavior during high retention months and suggest ways to replicate this success throughout the year.**

        | Promote small, bundle offers                                 | Customers like low ticket, frequent buys               |
        | Stop spending more on ads without a clear strategy           | High spend months still had low retention              |
        | Use smarter, product-specific coupons                        | Current generic coupons are not working                |
        | Push winning products (like Drinkware, Apparel) in low months| These worked well in high retention months             |

    **Conclusion :**
        Retention is more about customer experience (low order value, delivery charges), not just ads or coupons.
        Focus on easy, low-friction buying and right product targeting in low months.
